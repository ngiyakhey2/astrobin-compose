# Astrobin Browser App

This app is a read-only app for browsing [Astrobin](https://astrobin.com).

This app is being developed as part of a hackathon project, and may never reach production. The 
primary goal for this app is to "dogfood" Jetpack Compose.

## API Credentials

This app requires an API Key to the [Astrobin API](https://welcome.astrobin.com/application-programming-interface)

Once you have the key and secret, you must add it to your local `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` file:

```
ASTROBIN_API_KEY=<key>
ASTROBIN_API_SECRET=<secret>
```

And then you should be good to go!
